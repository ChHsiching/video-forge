# Delivery playbook

Mechanics for the delivery gates, timing, verification, audio, covers, platform variants, and publish copy. These are defaults — do them, and mention them, rather than asking. The gate names and the advance-blocking rule live in SKILL.md Step 5; this file carries each gate's **check command**. Every gate is judged by running its command and reading the output against stated numbers — a downstream "done" or a self-assessed pass never clears a gate; only the check does. On a failed check, fix and re-run the whole gate.

## G1 — stills approval

Render one still per distinct layout/asset state (not per scene), present as a labeled sheet, and get the user's explicit go. The gate clears on the user's approval — record it; silence is not approval, and G2's render command is not issued before it.

## G2 — cheap full render with audio

Render the full video at 1080p **with the final audio mix in place** (540p for long videos — see the scale note below). Two checks, in order:

1. **Spec check** (machine):
   ```
   ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=width,height,avg_frame_rate -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 <video>
   ```
   Dimensions, fps, and duration match the intake answers and the generated timing table.
2. **User check**: the user watches and approves content and timing.

(540p via scale 0.5 is ~2× faster than 1080p — per-frame overhead dominates. 360p via scale is not an option: a decimal third of 1080 lands on a fractional height and the renderer rejects non-integer dimensions — stick to 0.5/0.75.)

## G3 — content gates on the cheap render

All three run on the G2 file — content truth lives in the rendered file (a stale bundle renders stills fine while the video breaks, so stills alone never clear content). All must report clean before G4; fixes are cheap here. Threshold heuristics lose to the pixel diff and neutral reads: textured or sparse layouts that defeat a brightness check get resolved by G3c, not by relaxing the gate.

**G3a — audio mix** (targets in the loudness section below):
```
ffmpeg -i <video> -af ebur128 -f null NUL          # whole file → integrated + true peak
ffmpeg -ss <speech-window> -t 5 -i <video> -af ebur128 -f null NUL
ffmpeg -ss <music-only-window> -t 3 -i <video> -af ebur128 -f null NUL
```
Read `I:` and `Max True Peak:` against the targets. (On macOS/Linux use `-f null -`; `NUL` is the Windows spelling.)

**G3b — blank-scene sweep**: per scene, diff the 85%-through frame against the faded-out final frame:
```python
# <video> <scenes.json: [{"start":F,"dur":F},...] → prints per-scene mean abs diff; any ≤3 flags empty
import json,subprocess,sys
from PIL import Image,ImageStat
v,scenes=sys.argv[1],json.load(open(sys.argv[2]))
for s in scenes:
    fs=[]
    for f in (int(s["start"]+s["dur"]*0.85), s["start"]+s["dur"]-2):
        subprocess.run(["ffmpeg","-y","-v","error","-i",v,"-vf",f"select=eq(n\\,{f})","-frames:v","1",f"tmp{f}.png"])
        fs.append(Image.open(f"tmp{f}.png").convert("L"))
    d=sum(abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(fs[0].getdata(),fs[1].getdata()))/(fs[0].width*fs[0].height)
    print(s["start"],round(d,2),"EMPTY" if d<=3 else "ok")
```
Any scene flagged EMPTY fails the gate. (The scenes list is the generated timing table — same source of truth.)

**G3c — neutral content reads**: vision-model reads of extracted frames use neutral prompts (describe what is present). Deep-dark or sparse layouts that defeat G3b's threshold get resolved here, not by relaxing the gate.

## G4 — final render + artifacts

Render final (4K: read `remotion-4k-polish` first; long videos: `scripts/render_segments.sh` + `check_segments.sh`), then each artifact's check:

**Covers** — per required ratio, dimensions verified:
```python
from PIL import Image; import sys
for p in sys.argv[1:]: im=Image.open(p); print(p, im.size, "OK" if im.width>=1920 else "TOO SMALL")
```
Existence + size per the intake platform list; which ratios and the design rules live in the Covers section below.

**Publish copy** — section presence and every length rule, by `len()` against each platform's counting rule (format rules in the publish-copy section below): titles within limits, three description versions present, four chapter versions present, chapter names ≤11 chars, `HH:MM:SS` format, chapter counts ≤10 (bilibili) / ≤15 (xiaohongshu), xiaohongshu body ≤100, pinned comment ≤300.

**Ending** — extract the final frame and one ~3s before it; the final frame is the sign-off card (not black), the card is ≤2s, hard cut.

**Output directory purity** — `ls` the output directory; it contains deliverables and nothing else (no logs, temp stills, partial renders).

## Audio-first timing (narrated videos)

When narration is TTS and intake settled the timing authority as audio-first (the default), the timeline derives from audio, never from design estimates:

1. Write and gate the narration script, then **freeze** it. Every sentence changed after synthesis means re-synthesis, re-timing, and a re-render of everything downstream — confirm with the user before touching a frozen script.
2. Synthesize per-segment audio (tts-forge).
3. Derive timing from measured durations — **by running a script over the segment files, never by hand arithmetic** (hand-computed cumulative starts have produced real off-by-hundreds errors). The derivation, once implemented:
   - scene length = `ceil((segment_duration + pad) × fps)`, pad ≈ 0.7s breathing room
   - scene starts are cumulative; the last segment's end is the composition length
   - caption spans per scene: detect speech pauses (`ffmpeg silencedetect` at −32dB, ≥0.16s), place each cue boundary at the pause nearest its character-proportional estimate (fall back to the estimate when no pause within 0.7s), convert to frames
4. Scenes and captions consume the generated tables. Proportional rescaling of caption times desyncs against real speech pacing — re-anchor to pauses instead.

## Audio mix baseline (G3a targets)

bilibili transcodes without loudness normalization — what you upload is what viewers hear; YouTube pulls down toward about −14 LUFS and never boosts. Targets for narration-led video:

- Integrated loudness: −16 LUFS ±1
- True peak: ≤ −1 dBTP
- Music bed: 12-18 dB under the voice; the high end when clarity matters
- Verify with an ebur128 three-window read: whole file, a speech window, a music-only window

## Long-video render strategy (anything over ~15 minutes)

**Maximize parallelism to the actual hardware — measure, then compute, never accept a default queue count:**

1. Probe: logical CPU count and FREE RAM (not total — a "cleaned" machine frees twice the queues).
2. Calibrate on the first render: an instance saturates ~3-4 cores regardless of `--concurrency` (architectural), but its RAM scales with output resolution (~6-8GB at 4K, less at 1080p) — measure one running instance, then compute `queues = min(floor(cores/4), floor(free_ram_gb / measured_instance_gb), remaining_segment_count)`. Two remaining segments means two queues; a third lane has nothing to render.

- **Segmented rendering**: split into N frame-exact segments (each an independent encode), render sequentially or in 2-3 parallel instance queues, concat with stream copy. Zero quality loss: same encoder settings per segment, no re-encode at the join.
- **Resume**: segments already on disk are skipped — a crashed run costs only the in-flight segment.
- `render_segments.sh` gates concat on the integrity check itself; a hand-driven segment run needs `scripts/check_segments.sh` first.

## Windows render environment

- A killed render leaves node/chrome-headless processes alive that lock partial outputs (`rm` reports "Device or resource busy"). Kill them first — `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` filtered on `remotion` in the command line, `Stop-Process` each — then delete partials.
- Render commands run bare, no pipes: `… | tail` eats the real exit code and a failed render reports success.
- Pass `--port` explicitly — the renderer's internal server defaults to 3000, which collides with WSL port forwarding on dev machines.
- Keep `public/` lean: narration WAVs and screenshots pile into tens of MB and slow every bundle copy. On an intermittent copy timeout, retry once before diagnosing.

## Ending & completion rate

- The video ends when the music ends — fade the audio over the outro and cut. Silent tails and fade-to-black tails both cost completion rate: end on the card, hard cut.
- Sign-off card: ≤2s total, its animation done within ~1s, then straight to the end.
- Closing copy states a takeaway or next action; begging CTAs ("评论区说" / "comment below") read as filler — engagement prompts belong in the pinned comment.
- Platform variant cards (e.g. bilibili triple-action) render as a **composition props variant** inserted before the outro — the variant joins the timeline with native transitions, and both platform versions build from one codebase. (File-level concat of a separately rendered tail is the fallback: it needs aligned streams — e.g. a silent audio track on the tail — and re-checking the join.) A triple-action card keeps the same budget: icons pop in fast and asynchronously within ~1s, hard end at ≤2.5s.

## Covers

- Explore before finalizing: produce 3-4 covers with genuinely different visual concepts — different metaphor and information organization. Rearranging the same elements, or reusing video components (a scene's terminal card, the header bar), yields variations of one cover rather than options; the user picks from real alternatives, then the chosen concept gets built out in every required ratio.
- One cover per ratio the intake platform list implies — typically 16:9 (1920×1080) and 4:3 (1440×1080) for bilibili/xiaohongshu; a YouTube-only job needs no 4:3. **A 4:3 cover is its own layout** — vertical space runs out differently, so design it from scratch (move footnotes, re-center blocks, re-fit type); scaling a 16:9 layout down produces wrapped titles and clipped cards.
- Large type only — everything a thumbnail must communicate at ≥48px at 1080-scale. Small text on covers is invisible in feeds; write nothing you wouldn't read at 200px wide.
- Chinese title should be sans/bold (serif CJK reads thin at cover sizes) and at least as prominent as any English title — viewers read the language they know to decide what the video is.
- **Verify by reading, not by metric**: downsampled-pixel brightness checks are blind to thin/colored text (green prompt lines, gray footnotes — all below threshold). Downscale the full cover to ASCII art and read it; this catches wraps, overlaps, and missing elements that metrics pass.
- The cover is an independent design — a frame from the video is not a cover.

## Publish copy

Per-platform deliverable, written after the video is final (facts on screen are then frozen). Full spec below — kept in sync with video-subtitle's SKILL.md Step 6 (same rules maintained there for cook runs; when either changes, change both).

**Plain text inside paste blocks.** Platforms render markdown literally: `**bold**` shows as asterisks, `-` markers show as hyphens. The upload.md file may use markdown for its own sections; the fenced paste-block content is plain text with line breaks, list items as `·` or `1. 2. 3.`.

**Titles — multiple, per platform:**

- **bilibili**: professional, ~30 chars, telling the viewer what happens in the video (e.g. "从零搭建一个全新项目"), with the author's identity when recognizable. A title the viewer needs the description to understand is the wrong title.
- **xiaohongshu**: ≤20 chars, same professional tone, zero marketing language ("大佬带你", "效率翻倍").
- **YouTube**: may carry "(双语字幕)" or the English title variant.

**Description — three versions:**

1. **Full (bilibili/YouTube)**, five parts in order:
   - 定调句 (1-2 sentences): author + what they did + one-sentence value — "X 用 Y 做了 Z", never "来自 X 的讲解".
   - 看点 (numbered): hooks with a teaser, not a table of contents — each item carries suspense, not a flat fact.
   - 关键内容 (`·` list): key beats as "label: content" pairs — a scannable index, easier than a flat list.
   - 来源 (`·` list): `来源：` / `· 作者：` / `· 原视频：` / `· 网站/仓库：` — structured, never inline.
   - 结尾话术 (verbatim): `字幕：AI 辅助转录 + 翻译并经人工校对。如有不准确之处，欢迎指出。` — for original-narration videos (no translation), the honest adaptation: `字幕与口播：AI 辅助制作并经人工校对。如有不准确之处，欢迎指出。`
2. **xiaohongshu pinned comment (≤300 chars, every character counted as the platform counts)**: the first three paragraphs compressed plus the closing note. Leave out 看点, 关键内容, and links — they eat the budget. Verify with `len()`; compress until it fits.
3. **xiaohongshu body (≤100 chars)**: one sentence — who published what, the core topic, why watch. No metadata ("双语字幕" belongs in the pinned comment). Verify with `len()`.

**Chapters — four versions, all produced (a hard checklist, not a menu):**

1. bilibili platform field (≤10): `HH:MM:SS` + name ≤11 chars
2. xiaohongshu platform field (≤15): same format
3. YouTube platform field: same format
4. Pinned-comment full list: `HH:MM:SS` + one descriptive sentence per chapter, no length limit

Timestamps come from the actual delivered timeline (an audio-first run reads the generated timing table). Tone throughout: translator, not promoter.

**Verify before handover**: title lengths, chapter counts and name lengths, description char counts — each against its platform's counting rule, by `len()`.
